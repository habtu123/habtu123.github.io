1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):

	var a = 5;
	var b = 10;
	var c = function(a, b, c) {
	var x = 10;
	document.write(x);
	document.write(a);
	var f = function(a, b, c) {
	b = a;
	document.write(b);
	b = c;
	var x = 5;
	}
	f(a,b,c);
	document.write(b);
	 }
	c(8,9,10);
	document.write(b);
	document.write(x);
}
