JSP Custom Tags Quiz
1. Rewrite the JSP page in the first demo (forEach) to use scripting instead of the JSTL forEach.
	 <% Student [] table = (Student []) request.getAttribute(“student”);%>
		 <% for (int i = 0; i < table.length; i++){ %>
		 <tr>
		 <td><%= table[i].getName() %></td>
		<td><%=table[i].getAge() %></td>
		</tr>
	<%}%>
2. How do custom tags relate to JSTL?

	JSTL is a standard library of JSP actions, on the other hand when EL and Standard Action elements aren't
	enough to remove scriptlet code from your JSP Page, you can use Custom Tags. Custom tags are nothing
	but user-defined tags. Custom tags are an excellent way to abstract the complexity of business logic
	from the presentation of Web pages in a way that is easy for the Web author to use and control. It also
	allows for reusability as custom tags can be used again and again.

3. What is the role of the URI in the TLD and the taglib directive?

	The role of the URI attribute in the TLD and taglib directive is to resolves a location the container
	understands where the TLD file is.

4. What is a tag handler class?

	Tag handler class are classes that extends the tag support framework class, and implements the custom
	tag functionality.
You can create a Tag Handler class in two different ways:
 -By implementing one of three interfaces: SimpleTag, Tag or BodyTag, which define methods that
are invoked during the life cycle of the tag.
- By extending an abstract base class that implements the SimpleTag, Tag, or BodyTag interfaces.
The SimpleTagSupport, TagSupport, and BodyTagSupport classes implement the SimpleTag, Tag
andBodyTag interfaces. Extending these classes relieves the tag handler class from having to
implement all methods in the interfaces and also provides other convenient functionality. 

5. What is the role of attribute setters in a tag handler class?
When we create a custom tag we need a setter for each attribute of custom tag in order to set the
values into these variables that will be provided at the time of using this custom tag.

6. What is the role of the doTag() method in a tag handler class?

	It renders the custom tag.

7. What does the operation getJspContext().getOut().write(“Hi Bob”) do when called in a doTag()
method?

	It prints out “Hi Bob”. 

8. What does the operation getJspBody().invoke(null) do when called in a doTag() method?
It means process the body of the tag and print it to the response. The null argument means the output
goes to the response rather than some other write we pass in.
